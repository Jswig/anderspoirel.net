**Data scientist**, [Joby Aviation](https://www.jobyaviation.com/) *(Dec. 2021 - present)*

- Developed a framework on top of Apache Spark that let domain experts easily
  implement checks on flight data. Led to 1000+ checks saving X,000 hours on flight
  data review.

- Built foundational tools used by a data science team of 17. Some highlights include
  a new build system 10× faster than the previous one; a library enabling the migration
  of 100s of users to Unity Catalog while maintaining seamless compatibility
  with existing systems.

- Deep performance and cost optimization work. Sped up 40× a
  query tool used by 100s of engineers. Cluster usage optimization tied to $X00,000
  annual savings.

- Introduced several practices that raised productivity across my team:
  infrastructure as code, end-to-end tests, version control for batch jobs. Became
  a recognized expert sought inside and beyond my organization for advice on data and
  software architecture, productionizing data science workloads.

**Data scientist intern**, [Joby Aviation](https://www.jobyaviation.com/) *(Jul. 2021 - Nov. 2021)*

- Built several analytics web applications. Spun out component library and deployment
  framework from this effort which were used for 30+ internal applications.

**Data scientist intern**, [Fullpower Technologies](https://www.fullpower.com/) *(Jan. 2021 - Jun. 2021)*

- Ran comparative analysis of sleep studies data that was used in the medical device's FDA
  submission packet.

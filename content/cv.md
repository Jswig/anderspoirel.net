## Work

**Senior data engineer**, [Plasmidsaurus](https://www.plasmidsaurus.com/) *(Aug. 2025 - Jun. 2026)*

**Data scientist**, [Joby Aviation](https://www.jobyaviation.com/) *(Jul. 2021 - Jul. 2025)*

<!-- - Developed a framework on top of Apache Spark that let domain experts easily
  implement checks on flight data. Led to 1000+ checks saving X,000 hours on flight
  data review.

- Built foundational tools used by a data science team of 17. Some highlights include
  a new build system 10× faster than the previous one; a library enabling the migration
  of 100s of users to Unity Catalog while maintaining seamless compatibility
  with existing systems.

- Deep performance and cost optimization work. Sped up 40× a
  query tool used by 100s of engineers. Cluster usage optimization tied to $X00,000
  annual savings.

- Introduced several practices that raised productivity across my team:
  infrastructure as code, end-to-end tests, version control for batch jobs. Became
  a recognized expert sought inside and beyond my organization for advice on data and
  software architecture, productionizing data science workloads. -->

<!-- - Built several analytics web applications. Spun out component library and deployment
  framework from this effort which were used for 30+ internal applications. -->

**Data scientist intern**, [Fullpower Technologies](https://www.fullpower.com/) *(Jan. 2021 - Jun. 2021)*

<!-- - Ran comparative analysis of sleep studies data that was used in the medical device's FDA
  submission packet.
- Ported models to AWS Inferentia chips, doubling inference throughput without
  increasing costs. -->

**Research assistant**, [UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute](https://genomics.ucsc.edu/) *(Oct. 2020 - Jun. 2021)*

**Research intern**, [Center for Research in Open Source Software](https://cross.ucsc.edu/) *(Jul. 2020 - Sep. 2020)*

## Technical Expertise

***Languages & tools***: Python (especially the data stack), Go, SQL,
Apache Spark & Delta Lake, Snowflake, Docker, Terraform.

***Domains***: data engineering/analytics engineering, build systems & CI,
back-end web development, machine learning, business intelligence.

I've also dabbled  in statistics (insofar as it's a distinct topic from ML), front-end
(especially for data visualization) and infrastructure engineering
(a.k.a. YAML templating for the uncharitable).
